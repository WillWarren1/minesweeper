# Minesweeper


## Goal

My goal with this project was to create a website where a user could play the *CLASSIC* game Minesweeper.

## Behind the Scenes

I built this game by creating an HTML table populated with data from [this Minesweeper API](https://minesweeper-api.herokuapp.com/). I built the website using [React](https://reactjs.orggit) within the [VS Code Text Editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
